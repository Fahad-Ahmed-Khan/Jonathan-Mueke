                                                This meant that there was no ward without a street lighting program in Nairobi. The immediate
                                                impact from the street lighting program was a sharp reduction in the crime rate in Nairobi. In
                                                2013 around 1800 serious cases used to be reported every year. This was reduced to less than
                                                200 cases reported annually as a direct result of the street lighting program and installation of
                                                CCTV cameras.
