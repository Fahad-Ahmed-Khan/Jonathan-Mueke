			<p class="text-justify" style="color:#666;margin-top:10%;">From a wiry erratic teenager to a formidable, relentless leader, Hon. Jonathan Mueke, has always been a prodigy in a hurry. Buoyed by a charming self-esteem and disarming chutzpah, the gubernatorial candidate for Kitui County may be soft spoken, but he has weathered the hard waters that rocks a politician’s life.
			
			

<p class="mt-5" style="color:#666;margin-top:20%;">Not by any small measure: He’s served in government, and felt the trappings of power: “I learnt that when you’re in government, you can make decisions that can affect a population. And if you have the political will, you can use that power to make those decisions to change people’s lives. So I took interest in leadership.”</p>

Mueke’s leadership potential has been earmarked in both professional and political spheres, earning him honors locally and abroad, including being an elected member of Strathmore ‘Who’s Who in leadership (USA).’ He was also the founding President of the Kenya Community Abroad, Michigan Chapter and is an alumnus of the exclusive Sunwords leadership unusual FFWD program. A hunger to be the best, to whose leadership is defined by servitude, a man who has abstained from the fame of politics to master, more than anyone, the politics of fame.
</p>
<p style="color:#666;">“I bought my first house when I was 22. I started working at 19 when I got into college. I first ran for office when I was 30. I became a deputy governor at 36.” Ambition, then, has always been a cooly lit fire beneath his sails.</p></div>

Mueke was born into a family of six under the stewardship of his parents Dr & Mrs Mueke from Kitui County. 
	He was a prefect all through primary and secondary school. 
	At the university, he was the organising secretary of the African Students Association in the US. 
	He did a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science (Wayne State University), an MBA in Information Technology (Oakland University).  
	While still in the USA, he worked at Wayne State University as a Systems Administrator, K-Mart Corporation as a Y2K Systems Developer, DaimlerChrysler Corporation as a Project Manager and FiServ Incorporated as a Technology Services Manager.
<p class="mt-5" style="color:#666;margin-top:20%;">Mueke has served as Nairobi’s Deputy Governor, overseeing the Trade & Corporative, Roads & Infrastructure, Agriculture, Youth and ICT ministries in the County. His appetite for the long nights and tireless days, a burning ambition in leading the County Delivery Unit ensuring that all county projects were executed properly, were sustainable and had the desired impact to the public. </p>

	He ran for the Westlands parliamentary seat unsuccessfully in 2007. 
	“I raised money from well-wishers and friends. I had researched the problems of the people of Westlands and came up with a manifesto addressing all of them. 
	I put together a think tank. I did competitive analysis of my competitors. I campaigned hard. When I went to Kihumbuini Primary School in Kangemi I found my
	campaign team wearing orange T-shirts voting for Fred Gumo. And that’s when I knew I had lost the elections.”
</p>
<p style="color:#666;">It was a baptism by fire. A fire that is now blazing, seeking to provide warmth for others. 
Hon. Mueke’s fire is in Kitui.
 Here, he brings his experience, credibility, integrity, competence and transformative leadership skills — just what Kitui needs to face the challenges of lack of water, youth unemployment, infrastructure development, service delivery, inefficiency and change management. 
 His fire is one that burns with a global network of investors with the capacity to exploit Kitui’s natural & mineral resources to the benefit and wealth creation of the people of Kitui.

	“I’m auguring toward a substantive public office where I can make decisions that solve people’s problems.”
<p class="mt-5" style="color:#666;margin-top:20%;">He has termed it ‘Our Challenge’. Because that’s how he tackles things: he takes it up as a challenge. To make it better
. To inspire. To lead, teach and serve. He’s already heaved two companies from the ground. </p>
<p class="mt-5" style="color:#666;margin-top:20%;">He is sweat and bone, blood and pain. That’s the language of the worker. The language of Kitui people.
 The never-say-die attitude. And like most people, who build the world with their sweat and strain, he does not take 
 it for granted. When you know what loss is, you appreciate the gains. But can he restore Kitui to a new found glory?</p>

In my younger days, 
	I was a little bit aggressive. I wanted things done right and sometimes I would come off as aloof or arrogant.
	I’ve also become more sensitive to other people’s needs than to myself.” 
In his relentless quest for personal improvement, his work ethic, servitude and leadership is a masterclass in a most
 important life-lesson: There can always be someone more gifted around the corner, but if you work your backside off, 
 success and fame have no choice but to knock on your door.
</p>
<p style="color:#666;">“Now I am looking at how to impact the community, the region and the world.”</p>
<p style="color:#666;">Hon. Jonathan Mueke. Father of two. Father-figure to many. He rises, head and shoulders, 
above what he terms as a dire need for change, but those shoulders are broad enough to allow us
 to climb up there with him and see that we’re in this together.</p>
